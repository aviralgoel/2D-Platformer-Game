Journey into the Medieval realms of Dhofar, dodge the mythic creatures and collect magical items from conquering the land of Dhofar.

This is my first Unity 2D Game. This project enlightened me on the workings of 

1. Singleton Design Pattern (for Game, Sound, Level Managers)
2. Unity 2D Tile Maps (for level design and creation)
3. Unity's UI system, 2D Animations, and animation states.
4. 2D Physics, forces, and collision system.
5. Unity Script execution order
6. Gameobjects, components, and prefab management
7. Git for version control
